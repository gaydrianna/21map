You have different options for exporting your odyssey.js visualization. You can either embed this using an iframe, publishing with a click on bl.ocks or just share the URL of this visualization.

If you want to customize it further, you can download the generated source code by clicking on the button below.

#Advanced users

Check out our [documentation](/odyssey.js/documentation/) to learn how to use odyssey to create more custom things. It's crazy the amount of cool things that can be done with the library.

Also if you are a developer, take a look at our contributing guideline so you can push code to the actual library.

Cheers!
